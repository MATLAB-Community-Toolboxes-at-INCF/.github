# MCTs at INCF
MATLAB Community Toolboxes (MCTs) at the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF)

## About this Organization
MATLAB community toolboxes (MCTs) are open-source code distributions of structured functionality built with MATLAB. This INCF GitHub organization hosts new or transitional codebases, selected based on their potential for broad usage. The day-to-day administration of this organization is managed by its associated [INCF Working Group](https://www.incf.org/sig/incfmathworks-working-group-early-stage-matlab-community-toolboxes). 

Through this GitHub organization, the Working Group cultivates, maintains, and disseminates [Working Best Practices (WBPs)](#working-best-practices-wbps-for-neuroscience-mcts) to guide toolbox developers and repository stewards towards various high-level goals, including toolbox visibility, usability, quality, and maintainability. Among these WBPs are current MathWorks' recommendeations for community toolboxes, as relevant in the neuroscience context. 

The Working Grup aspires that many of the MCTs maintained in this GitHub organization will transition to more permanent individual- or organization-led development over time. 

The Working Group (and this organization) are sponsored by the MATLAB Community Toolbox (MCT) program at MathWorks.
