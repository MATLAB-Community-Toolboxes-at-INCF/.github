# Welcome to MCTs at INCFðŸ‘‹ 

## About 
MATLAB community toolboxes (MCTs) are open-source MATLAB codebases providing structured functionality. This GitHub organization (org) hosts **new or orphaned MCTs with potential for broad usage**. This org is the primary activity of an INCF* [working group](https://www.incf.org/sig/incfmathworks-working-group-early-stage-matlab-community-toolboxes) sponsored by the MATLAB Community Toolbox program.   
<sub>*INCF: [International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility](https://www.incf.org/)</sub>

## TBD
The organization aims to develop and maintain consensual guidelines and templates for GitHub repository stewardship. It will also elaborate on and disseminate best practices, including MathWorksâ€™ recommendations for community toolboxes, as relevant in the neuroscience context. Finally, the organization aspires that many of the selected MATLAB community toolboxes will transition to more permanent individual- or organization-led development over time. 

This organization is sponsored by the MATLAB Community Toolbox (MCT) program at MathWorks.
