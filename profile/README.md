# MCTs at INCF
MATLAB Community Toolboxes (MCTs) at the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF)

## About this Organization
MATLAB community toolboxes (MCTs) are open-source code distributions of structured functionality built with MATLAB. This INCF GitHub organization hosts new or transitional codebases, selected based on their potential for broad usage. The day-to-day administration of this organization is managed by its associated [INCF Working Group](https://www.incf.org/sig/incfmathworks-working-group-early-stage-matlab-community-toolboxes). 

Through this GitHub organizationm, the Workging Group aims to develop and maintain consensual guidelines and templates for GitHub repository stewardship. It will also elaborate on and disseminate working best practices, including MathWorks‚Äô recommendations for community toolboxes, as relevant in the neuroscience context. Finally, the Working Grup aspires that many of the selected MATLAB community toolboxes will transition to more permanent individual- or organization-led development over time. 

The Working Group (and this organization) are sponsored by the MATLAB Community Toolbox (MCT) program at MathWorks.
